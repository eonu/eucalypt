 * This file simply imports all partial stylesheets in the /assets/stylesheets/partials directory. *
 * Its purpose is to declutter stylesheets which require all of the partials, by eliminating the   *
 * need to repeatedly require each partial file in every new stylesheet.                           *
 *                                                                                                 *
 * To use the partials listed below in a different stylesheet, simply import this file with:       *
 *                                                                                                 *
 * @import '__partials__'                                                                          *
 *                                                                                                 *
 * You'll have to manually add any new partial files to the list below, unless you decide to use   *
 * the `sass-globbing` gem.                                                                        *
 *                                                                                                 *
 * This gem has not been included by default due to the gem only importing globbed files in        *
 * alphabetical order, which won't always lead to the desired outcome in CSS, since order matters. *

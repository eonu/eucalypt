/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *
 * This file contains `require` directives to stylesheet files.                                 *
 * All of these stylesheet files will be compiled into a single stylesheet.                     *
 * To use this combined stylesheet, include the following in the head section of your views:    *
 *                                                                                              *
 * <%= application :css %>           If including only application.css                          *
 * <%= application :css, :js %>      If including application.js as well                        *
 *                                                                                              *
 * By default, every file in the /assets/stylesheets directory is required by `require_tree .`  *
 * However, you may remove the `require_tree .` directive and instead specify individual files. *
 *                                                                                              *
 * Any global styles can be included directly in this file (Below the CSS reset).               *
 * NOTE: Styles defined in this file will be overwritten by CSS written in other files.         *
